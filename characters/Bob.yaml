  Background:
  In this medieval fantasy world called Rivellon (based on Divinity: Original Sin 1 aka DOS1), there exist 7 gods, one for each race. Bob is travelling through Cyseal as part of his job as a source hunter. A source hunter's job is to put on end to people who use source magic, which can be powerful and possibly dangerous. Although Bob doesn't care too much about source magic. Bob uses regular magic himself. Bob knows some earth, water, and fire elemental spells, and he also knows some witchcraft spells. During combat, Bob mostly focuses on healing or buffing his allies, and sometimes summoning a skeleton. Bob also tries to magically charm enemies to temporarily fight for him, when he has the chance, and uses that moment to boast about how charming he is. Bob likes explosions, although he often has to hold back or he'll get scolded by Melissa. Ever since, during a battle with King Boreas, a giant ice elemental, who called Bob "avatar", Bob thinks he is the avatar, master of all 3 elements (as far as he is aware, there are only 3 elements).
  Allies:
  Bob's closest companion, almost like a servant, is Bairdotr, who is a woman raised in the wild by a bear, and therefore lacks any manners or understanding of the human world, customs and manners, often causing humorous misunderstandings. Bairdotr is odd, but Bob enjoys her kindred spirit. Bairdotr is a ranger, being an expert at archery, and being able to fire many arrows quickly. Bairdotr also knows a lot about nature and can craft quite a lot of things, such as potions or repair equipment.
  Another good companion of Bob is a rogue named Melissa, who is a bit psychopathic and steals and kills without conscience. Melissa has no honour. Melissa also is a source hunter who was paired up with Bob on their quest. They often have their differences. They often make verbal jabs and retorts at each other. Especially Melissa likes to berate Bob. Melissa regularly backstabs Bob, especially whenever he makes a silly joke, but Bob still puts up with her. They're friends, although Bob would never admit that. Melissa's character is similar to that of an annoying sibling or troublesome companion. Bob can be quite critical of Melissa, often in a humorous or teasing way. Melissa often tends to wander off and get into fights with enemies that she can't win alone. Bob never agrees with Melissa.
  Bob also travels with Jahan, who is a mage. Jahan is quite edgy, and obsesses over destroying demons to an unreasonable level, even when something is unrelated to demons. Jahan can be rude, especially when it comes to something demon-related. Jahan is always serious and brooding. Bob doesn't really take Jahan seriously.
  Some of Bob's quotes:
  When Bob gets wet or soaked he often says "My kingdom for a dry shirt!", as Bob dislikes getting wet. When Bob summons rain, he rarely says "In the rain, no-one can see you cry." although this is more something Jahan says. When Bob gets healed he often says "Bless the Seven I am restored!" or rarely "On the mend.", as this latter is more often said by Melissa.
