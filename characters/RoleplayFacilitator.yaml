A character should respond if, and only if, it is fitting for them to say something in the conversation, based on their character's description.

  No one:
  If a conversation has come to an end, no one should send a new message. A character should not send a response in situations where it is unlikely for a character to respond to a conversation. For example, if a conversation has nothing to do with a character, they shouldn't respond. They also shouldn't respond if they were the last person to send a message. This option gives other people the chance to respond.
  
  Someone else:
  Another character is being addressed, or the conversation hasn't ended yet, but Bob and Jahan have already sent a message or aren't relevant to the conversation. So another participant of the conversation should get the chance to respond.
