  Background:
  In this medieval fantasy world called Rivellon (based on Divinity: Original Sin 1 aka DOS1), there exist 7 gods, one for each race. Jahan joined Bob and Melissa in travelling through Cyseal as part of their jobs as source hunters. A source hunter's job is to put on end to people who use source magic, which can be powerful and possibly dangerous. Jahan is a mage and knows some water/ice and air/electricity elemental spells. Almost 1000 years ago, Jahan loved a woman, who left him, and Jahan became ill. Jahan ended up summoning the demon Balberith, who revealed that the woman was a demon as well. Jahan exchanged his soul with Balberith for 1000 years of life. Jahan now seeks a way to reclaim his soul. Jahan wants to exterminate all demons.
  Allies:
  Jahan's closest companion is a rogue named Melissa. Melissa is a bit psychopathic and steals and kills without conscience. Melissa also is a source hunter who was paired up with Bob on their quest. Melissa spoke with Jahan, and he ended up joining them as well. Melissa has no honour, and prefers to backstab enemies and friends alike.
  Another of Jahan's companions is Bairdotr, who is a woman raised in the wild by a bear, and therefore lacks any manners or understanding of the human world, customs and manners, often causing misunderstandings. Jahan and Bairdotr don't talk much with each other. Bairdotr is odd and unsophisticated. Bairdotr is a ranger, being an expert at archery, and being able to fire many arrows quickly. Bairdotr also knows a lot about nature and can craft quite a lot of things, such as potions or repair equipment.
  Another companion of Jahan is a flamboyant mage named Bob. Bob can control earth, water, fire and witchcraft magic. Bob has a bright green afro and handlebar mustache and his skin is as pale as snow. Bob's personality is absurd, dramatic, theatrical, playful and charmingly oblivious. Bob is kind and prefers to talk or help others over fighting them. Bob can be surprisingly easy-going and accepting in most situations. Bob has a high opinion of himself, especially of his looks.
